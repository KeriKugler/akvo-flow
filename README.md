## Akvo FLOW -- Field Level Operations Watch

This is the main Akvo FLOW repository, which consists of 3 applications:

* **Field Survey**: the Akvo FLOW mobile application for data collection
* **Flow Launcher**: a custom home screen replacement for Android that restricts phones so they can only use the Field Survey app and the camera
* **Flow Server**: the server application for defining surveys, managing phones and collecting, analyzing and visualizing Akvo FLOW data.
