This is the root directory of the Flow Field Survey application.

The project depends on Android version 2.0.0

Before the project will build, the survey.properties file must be placed in the following location:
res/raw/
This file contains the secret keys needed to communicate with the Flow Server instance set up for a given organization.

This file is slated to be replaced via a central configuration service in an upcoming version.
