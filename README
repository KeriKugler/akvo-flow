This is the main repository for the FLOW system. It consists of 3 applications:
Field Survey - the FLOW mobile application for data collection
Flow Launcher - a custom home screen replacement for Android that locks phones down so they can only use Field Survey and the camera
Flow Server - the server application for defining surveys, managing phones, and collecting/analyzing/visualizing data.

The Field Survey application is rooted at WFPMapping/device/survey
Flow Launcher is rooted at WFPMapping/device/launcher
Flow Server is rooted at GAE
