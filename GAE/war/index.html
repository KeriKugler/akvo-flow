            <p>Millions of dollars are wasted every year on tens of thousands of
              water systems around the world that break, become abandoned and prove to
              be unsustainable. And every day, women and children in developing
              countries are cruelly reminded of the short-lived hope of clean water
              when they pass by broken hand pumps or capped wells in their villages,
              forcing them to again rely on unsafe water sources.</p>
            <p>Monitoring and evaluation is essential to fully understanding the
              progress of work, and implementing proactive changes that reduce
              development time and improve success. That is why we developed FLOW,
              Field Level Operations Watch.
            <p>Using Android cell phones, combined with GPS and Google Earth
              software, FLOW gives community members, partners, volunteers, and others
              the ability to record data from tens of thousands of water points around
              the world: location, service status, images, and other information. This
              data is then displayed online to signal whether a project is up and
              running, broken, or on the verge of disrepair and requiring maintenance.</p>

                <div>
                  <p>A diverse country, Bolivia is home to almost 9 million people who
                    live in three distinct regions: the high Altiplano, the fertile valleys,
                    and the tropical lowlands. In Bolivia, Water For People works in the
                    regions of Cuchumuela, Tiraque, San Pedro, Arani, San Benito, Villa
                    Rivero, and peri-urban Cochabamba.</p>
                  <p>In rural areas, only 68% of people have access to a safe and
                    reliable water supply.</p>
                  <p>In the next year, Cuchumuela is slated to reach full coverage for
                    access to water. The FLOW map will reflect the incredible shift as the
                    data is verified. Monitoring will show that for 3,000 Bolivians, many of
                    whom lay claim to hard lives on the sides of steep, remote
                    mountainsides, water can flow to even the most hard-to-reach
                    communities.</p>
                  <p>Working to improve access to safe water for "Everyone," FLOW will
                    help us to see what working, what's in disrepair, and what's broken.</p>

                    monitor their SWASH+ (School Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Education
                    Plus Community Impact) work in El Salvador.</p>

                <div>
                  <p>This country of proud Mayan heritage marries modern buildings and
                    practices with ancient, time-honored ways. Guatemala still struggles to
                    recover from a 36-year civil war that just ended in 1996 and displaced a
                    million people.</p>
                  <p>Water For People concentrates almost all its efforts in the
                    department of Quich&eacute;, northwest of Guatemala City. In addition,
                    we work in the regions of San Antonio Ilotenango, San Bartolom&eacute;
                    Jocotenango, San Pedro Jocopilas, and San Andres Sajcabaj&aacute;.</p>
                  <p>Water and sanitation problems are significant in Guatemala. Old
                    water systems function only intermittently, and people must often obtain
                    expensive water from tanker trucks or from unprotected sources.</p>
                  <p>Working to improve access to safe water for "Everyone," FLOW will

                <h2 id="cSelect-3"><a href="#">Honduras</a></h2>
                <div>
                  <p>Daunting challenges have spurred our work on in Honduras, where
                    one-fifth of the rural population has no access to safe drinking water
                    and almost half have no proper sanitation facilities. Honduras is the
                    poorest and least developed country in Central America.</p>
                  <p>Water For People works in the municipalities of Chinda, San
                    Antonio de Cortes, Ilama and El Negrito. Four years ago, none of the
                    local water systems in Chinda met government standards for quality or
                    quantity, and only 37 percent of residents had access to proper
                    sanitation.</p>
                  <p>Despite insufficient water and sanitation infrastructure,
                    torrential rains that often engulf roads and access routes, earthquakes,
                    political instability, and Hurricane Mitch's devastation in 1998, 14
                    communities with about 5,000 people in Chinda are on track to achieve
                    full coverage of safe water access within the year.</p>
                  <p>These data points, as well as data for the other regions in
                    Honduras mapped within FLOW, will be reflected on the map as they are
                    verified.</p>
                  <p>Working to improve access to safe water for "Everyone," FLOW will
                    help us to see what working, what's in disrepair, and what's broken.</p>

                <div>
                  <p>The need for safe water and sanitation are extremely critical in
                    one of the most densely populated areas of the world: West Bengal,
                    India. As our FLOW map shows, Water For People is monitoring the
                    viability of water and sanitation points in West Bengal, situated
                    between the Himalayas and the Bay of Bengal.</p>
                  <p>Water For People, working with 20 government and local partners
                    on the ground in six districts, supports arsenic mitigation and locally
                    sustainable drinking water, sanitation and hygiene interventions. The
                    West Bengal districts include South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas,
                    Nadia, East Medinipur, Murshidabad and Purulia.</p>
                  <p>India has one of the world's fastest growing economies and safe
                    water and proper sanitation go hand in hand with economic prosperity.</p>
                  <p>Working to improve access to safe water for "Everyone," FLOW will
                    help us to see what working, what's in disrepair, and what's broken.s</p>

                <div>
                  <p>Landlocked Malawi is among the world's poorest countries. Of its
                    11 million Africans, only 16 percent live in urban areas, mainly in the
                    cities of Lilongwe, Blantyre and a handful of smaller towns.</p>
                  <p>Water For People focuses on the regions of Blantyre, Chikhwawa,
                    and Rumphi. Water-related diseases, including cholera and typhoid, are
                    woefully common; a problem exacerbated by the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS
                    which has affected 15 percent of the rural population and 30 percent of
                    those in urban areas. About 62 percent of the rural population has
                    access to improved water; about 42 percent have improved sanitation.</p>
                  <p>Almost half of the population is under 15 years old and many of
                    these are orphans. The life expectancy in Malawi is only 41.</p>
                  <p>Working to improve access to safe water for "Everyone," FLOW will
                    help us to see what working, what's in disrepair, and what's broken.</p>

                  <p>Working in alliance with nonprofit El Porvenir, Water For People
                    works to secure water and sanitation coverage for impoverished people in
                    the northern department of Jinotega, Nicaragua. The third poorest
                    country in the western hemisphere after Haiti and Guatemala, Nicaragua
                    boasts Central America's largest freshwater lakes and river
                    systems&mdash;but safe drinking water is all too scarce.</p>
                  <p>53% of rural Nicaraguans lack access to clean drinking water. 63
                    percent of the rural population has access to improved drinking water
                    sources and less than 40 percent of the rural population has access to
                    improved sanitation.</p>
                  <p>Like far too many developing world countries, water-related
                    diseases are a leading cause of death for children under five in
                    Nicaragua. And water poverty keeps children from attending
                    school&mdash;the average educational level in rural Nicaragua is 3.6
                    years of schooling.</p>
                  <p>Working to improve access to safe water for "Everyone," FLOW will

                    renowned for its beautiful, wild landscape and ancient traditions that
                    live on today.</p>
                  <p>But Peru is also known for its shifting and often harsh social
                    and economic landscape. As these factors rippled across Peru, its people
                    were plunged deeper into poverty and forced to struggle on with unsafe
                    water and inadequate sanitation.</p>
                  <p>For Peru, which is a new country program for Water For People,
                    FLOW is helping us to evaluate the current "baseline" status in rural
                    municipalities including Cascas, Majes and Tumbaden. In Tumbaden, Water
                    For People recently partnered with Soluciones Practicas to rehabilitate
                    and expand a community-school water system, marking this its first field

                  <p>Water For People works in the regions of Rulindo and Kicukiro.
                    About 65 percent of the population in densely populated Rwanda has
                    access to drinking water. However, only 38 percent throughout the
                    country have access to latrines that meet adequate hygienic conditions.</p>
                  <p>Watch this map during the next few years to see the impact of the
                    Rulindo Challenge, an initiative to provide 100% water supply coverage
